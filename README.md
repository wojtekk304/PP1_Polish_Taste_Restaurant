# UX

## Design 
For my website I have used mostly 3 colors for the background I used #ffffff White ,for the Logo and main headings I used black #202020 and for the other text I used Grey #606060.

## Wireframe
I have created wireframe for my website before starting to code it as It is easier for me to have the website layout planned out before I started. You can see the wireframes below, to do this I used balsamiq wireframe program.

## Testing
I have tested my website everytime I have added new line of code of html and css.
I have done that by saving my code and preview it in local server from gitpod,if everything was ok I would then continue with my work If I have found any error in responsivness of my website I would always correct it before I continue.

### Validation
I have validate my code by using w3c html and css validators, there was no errors reported on any of the code.

### Issues
I have encountered and Issue with the nav bar as it was not responsive in mobile version in order to fix it I have to change the code to use flexbox instead which I have learned it from w3c school.

### Deployment
I have used Github Pages to Deploy my website.

### Lighthouse
I have used Lighthouse to determinate performance,accessability,best practices and SEO.
